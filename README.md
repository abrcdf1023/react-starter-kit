### Why not create-react-app ?

We know that it has a script is "npm run eject" and it's official page say,

> You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

So that's what's this repo doing for, we need to customize the webpack and use the latest tools include babel, eslint, jest etc.

But it also means unstable, you have to make your own decision.

Also I provide a simple example try to show the best practice in react, redux and other popular tools.

If you're interesting in example please checkout to [react-starter-kit-example](https://github.com/abrcdf1023/react-starter-kit-example)

Any advice is welcome.
