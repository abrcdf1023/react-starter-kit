### Why not create-react-app ?

This repo's keypoint is to use the latest webpack and develop tools.

With fully control webpack configs you can simply change the behaivor you want and don't need to learn any other extra tools.

Also I provide a redux structure and try to show the best practice in redux.

This repo is used to update your project include dependencies version and configs.

If you're interesting in example please checkout to [react-starter-kit-example](https://github.com/abrcdf1023/react-starter-kit-example)

Any advice is welcome.
