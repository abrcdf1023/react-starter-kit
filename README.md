### Why not create-react-app ?

We know that it has a script "npm run eject" and it's official page say,

> You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

That's the reason, we need to customize the webpack and use the latest tools include babel, eslint, jest etc. However it means unstable, you have to make the decision.

Also I provide an example try to show the best practice in react, redux and other popular libs.
